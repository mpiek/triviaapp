# Trivia App

Hello there! I'm just a person who loves trivia, and I've created this simple Trivia App. It's nothing fancy, but it does the job well.

## Inspired by OpenTDB

This app is a humble implementation of the Open Trivia Database. It's a great resource, and I thought it would be fun to create an app around it.

## Works Well with "Ultimate Trivia" Board Game

If you're a fan of the "Ultimate Trivia" board game, you might find this app useful. It covers the same categories, except for Sports. Here's what we have:

- History
- General Knowledge
- Animals
- Entertainment
- Geography
- Other ("17", "18", "19", "20", "24", "25", "26", "30")

## That's All

So, that's about it. Just a simple trivia app created by a trivia enthusiast. If you like trivia, give it a try. Enjoy!
